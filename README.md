# JIT -  `offline` collaboration tool using git

## This project is inspired by the internet blackout in Amhara region. 

- ***What does it basically do*** ?
    - It lets you use a **USB drive** as a **remote storage** for your git repository. Then you and your collaborators will have a copy of the remote repo found in the USB drive on their local machine.
    - So, you can pull and push from this/to this remote repo as if you are using github but the catch is - `It is offline`

### Prerequisites

1. A flash drive (USB drive)
    - This is used as a **remote storage** that you can share with the people you are collaborating with
2. Basic knowledge of **git** and **how it works**. Some basic commands too 😁😁 !!
    - This is because you are going to write them and get errors too
